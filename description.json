I'm writing here about myself as a human, I thought that you wanted to know about us something more than
the technical skills since we are providing you with our cover letter and CV.


My name is Ghadeer Al-Khataybeh and I am a full-stack software engineer, full of positive energy and ambitions
eager to learn and be a professional developer.

I've always known about my self that I am a self-motivated smart and autonomous learner, and what brought me to 
this field at the beginning is this challenging environment with problem-solving, learning, tracking new
technologies and to be up to date with this universe.
and then I figured out new stuff about myself !!
... why I'm in love with coding??

because software engineering revealed in me many things beyond what I thought it's my limit.
coding has taught me to be patient and never ever give up no matter what efforts and time it takes,
for me "the only impossible thing in this life is to bring back a dead person " other than that it's doable.

the joy when I'm making progress and solving a problem in my work is way more than the tiredness and what
a regular person should feel after a long and hard day of work, whenever I start working on something and start
to see my achievements I can't sleep anymore, I keep counting how many hours left to start my new day so I can go
back for coding, I even sometimes go to bed at 7 am to get 2 hours of sleep because I know a human being 
should get some sleep.

I know I can do it and I will start calling your team as "My team" even if didn't make this time I'll keep trying
and applying until I'm in with you guys.

the value that I can add to the company that they will be hiring committed discipline and hard working team member,
a person who will keep learning and improving along the way, someone adaptable flexible with so much sense of humor.
